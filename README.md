# :bulb: wiz_light - V 0.4.0 (out for testing)

One short note: If you have multible (>5) bulb connected to the HASS, please try to bring all online if you restart the HASS service/container.
Becuase on older HASS version the startup can be slowed down if multible bulbs are offline.

## :muscle: Change Log
- New in 0.4.: The bulb type and featerus will be autodetected.
- New in 0.4.: Fixing some other small issues. Updat to pywizlight 0.4.5
- Working ConfigFlow: Now the bulbs can be configured via UI
- Devices Registration: The Bulb now shows up as "Light" device
- [BETA] The colors now "correct" regarding the HS to RGB-CW conversation in the WiZ app. Thanks to @brettonw for incredible work!(should be tested with non-RGB and non-Kelvin bulbs!! )
- Poll Service: Now it is possible to trigger a status update from the bulb via HASS service. This can be helpful for automations (e.g. motion detectors).
- DNS and IPs Support: The bulbs can now be added with an DNS name or ip.
- Bulb Library Moved: The "YAML" file was removed (because of a policy from HASS dev) and moved to the `pywizlight` repo..
- Tones of other fixes, improvement and removed typos :wink:

### Still missing but "Work in Progress":

- Automatic detection for the supported kelvin range of the bulb. This should reduce the static overhead.
- Registration of the bulb to HASS via UDP API. There are features to register the HASS to the bulb to send UDP packages to the HASS if the state of the bulb was changed. This will made the Poll Service obsolete.
- A User Documentaion based on HASS Docs. (with screen shots etc.) will be added (soon :wink:)

### What is declined or rejected:

- Change of the speed of the transition from on to off and off->on. This is not supported via the UDP API and can only be configured via WiZ App.
- Custom Effekts will not be implemented in the HASS integration becaus of missing feature in HASS.

## Pull request in HA core

https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/44779

## Install for testing

1. Loggon to your HA or HASS with SSH
2. Got to the HA `custom_components` directory within the HA installation path (if this is not available - create this directory).
3. Run `cd custom_components`
4. Run `git clone https://github.com/sbidy/wiz_light` within the `custom_components` directory
5. Run `mv wiz_light/custom_components/wiz_light/* wiz_light/` to move the files in the correct diretory
6. Restart your HA/HASS service in the UI with `<your-URL>/config/server_control`
7. Add the bulbs to your `configuration.yaml` - You can not add the bulbs in the HA UI!! (configFlow is missing)

Questions? Check out the github project [pywizlight](https://github.com/sbidy/pywizlight)

## Enable Debug
```YAML
logger:
    default: warning
    logs:
      homeassistant.components.wiz_light: debug
```

## HA config

## You can now use the HASS UI to add the devices/integration.

To enable the platform integration after installation add

```
light:
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: <Name of the device>
    host: <IP of the bulb>
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: <Name of the device#2>
    host: <IP of the bulb#2>
```

If you want to use the integration as switch

```
switch:
  - platform: wiz_light
    name: <Name of the device>
    host: <IP of the socket>
```
